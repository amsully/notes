# Expectations Covariance Correlation and Causation

Exponential Random Variable

X is a continuous random variable with probability ::: lambda

Normal Random Variable

- Can change mean
- Can change position

### Joint Distributions of Normal Random Variables

- Normal Random variables are one of a handful of continuous random variables for which we can define tractable joint probability density functions.

long equation

- The parameter sigma=[...] .. is a 2x2 matrix that satisfies


#### Probability Mass

The **probability mass** of the region a < X1 < b,c < X2 < d

double integral... cant compute values

Rare to calculate integrals

### Marginals of Bivariate Random Variables

A **bivariate** distribution over two random variables X1 and X2 has marginal densities defined as follows:

p(X1 = x1) integrate: p(X1 = x1, X2 = x2)dx2

p(X2 = x2) integrate: p(X1 = x1, X2 = x2)dx1

- A remarkable property of the bivariate normal is that its marginal densities are also normal

- A bivariate distribution over two random variables X1 and X2 has conditional densities defined as follows

### Expected Value Rule

In theory, the expectations of any function f(.) of a continuous random variable can be found by integrating the product of the function and the density over the entire range X of the random variable

### Standard Expected Values

Exponential: E[X] = lambda
Normal: E[X] = neu
Bivariate Normal: E[X1] = nue1, E[X1]...

Independence 

- Two discrete random variables X and Y are independent if and only if P(X=x, Y=y) = P(x =x x)P(Y=y) for all x element of X and y element of Y.

- Two continuous random variables X and Y are independent if and only if p(X=x, Y=y) = p(X=x)p(Y=y) for all x element of X and ylement of Y

### Quantifying Dependence: Covariance

- The covariance between X and Y is one measure of dependence that quantifies the degree to which there is a linear relationship between X and Y.

The covariance between X and Y....

Maximum magnitude of the covariance depends on the variance of X and the variance and Y

- The correlation between X and Y is closely related to the covariance but is normalized to the range [-1.1], 1 indicated maximum positive covariance and -1 indicates maxumum negative covariance...
