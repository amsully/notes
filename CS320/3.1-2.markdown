# 3.1  Software Requirements

IEEE defines requirement as:

1. A condition of capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
2. A condition or a capability that must be met or possessed by a system ... to satisfy a contract

## 3.1.1 Need for SRS

- SRS established the basis for agreement between client, supplier on what product will do
- SRS provides a reference for validation of the final product

54% of all detected errors were after coding and 45% of these errors actually originated in requirements...

- A high quality SRS is a prerequisite to high quality software

Math about how costly it is to catch errors later pg 83

- high quality SRS reduced cost

## 3.1.2 Requirement Process

Figure 3.1 Page 86 - Requirement Process

# 3.2  Problem Analysis

## 3.2.1 Informal Approach

- Analysts go from the mind of clients to SRS

# 3.2.2 Data Flow Modeling

## Data Flow Diagrams and Data Dictionary

- DFD shows the flow of data through a system.

Figure 3.2 DFD of a system that pays workers page 92

- All external files are shown as a labeled straight line.
- Need for multiple data flows by a process represented with a \*
- Not a flow chart: flow chart show flow of control

Suggestions for constructing a data flow graph:

- Work your way consistently from the inputs to the outputs, or vice versa -- 
	- If you get stuck reverse directions
	- start with high level data flow graph with few major tranforms decribing the entire transformation from the inputs to outputs and then refine each transformation from with more detailed transformations
	- Never try to show control logic. If you think in terms of loops and iterations you need to stop and try again
	- Make use of * and + operations and show suffiecient detail in the data flow graph
	- Try drawing alternate data flow graphs before settling on one

DFD Notation

- '+' : sequences, repetition
- '|' means on or the other
- '\*' means one or more occurence

Common Errors

- Unlabeled data flows
- Missing data flows; information required by a process is not available
- Extraneous data flows;  some information is not being used in the process
- Consistency maintaining during refinement
- Missing processes
- Contains some control information

### Structured Analysis Method

- By understanding the states of data we can determine the functions
- Start with physical system - replaced by logical processs
- Any bubble that does not transform data is deleted
- Drawing DFD:
	- Start top down
		- Context diagram  - major inputs outputs
		- refined into description of different parts
